Our main focus for now will be integration with IT explorer. We will use their authentication method to authenticate users, which is a Cognito user pool, where users are provisioned from OneWelcome. Sidenote: This is done in a Just in Time fashion. When a OneWelcome user attempts to access IT explorer, only then will their Cognito user be created in the pool. Reason for this is that we do not want all Onewelcome users in the Cognito user pool (that would be many more users than will ever use the app). This Cognito user pool will be managed by Devex.

Our current plan is to integrate authentication for the API with the authentication system that is already in place for IT explorer, which is also done in Cognito. Devex manages a preTokenGeneration Lambda that fetches roles/scopes that a user has access to from a DynamoDB table, and those roles/scopes are passed to the target system as part of the access token. Authorization for the SoC relies on the role and position that a person occupies in the organization structure, which might also be useful information for other plugins in IT explorer. Therefore we are thinking to sync this person - organization structure data to the DynamoDB table that is already used by Devex and that will then be passed to the API requests in the access token. We already have the logic to get the person OU data from the OMA db, but we need to think how we can sync that real time to the DynamoDB table. Dynamo streams?
