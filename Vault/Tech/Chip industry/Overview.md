ASML produces machines that are used to produce microprocessors. It used to have competition from Japanese Nikon and Canon, but in the last years ASML has become clear market leader, even monopolist for the most advanced machines that use EUV (extreme utraviolet) lithography.

The major chip producers are TSMC, Samsung and Intel. Intel is still a company with a more classical setup, doing both designing and fabrication of chips. Most other American companies (AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm) have become fabless (they only design the chips) and they outsource the actual production to other companies, mostly in Asia, also called foundries. Gobalfoundries is one such company came into being when AMD split off its fabrication processes. However it is now a relatively small players. TSMC is one of the biggest players now in this world, as it was the first company that was able to mass produce using ASMLs EUV machines and use it to create the chips with the smallest transistors (and so highest transistor density). It is called a pure-play company, because it has focused only on the manufacturing process and is creating chips for customers using their designs (e.g. Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, etc). Samsung is also a big player in terms of producing the most advanced chips, probably behind TSMC but ahead of Intel. 

Processes expressed using nm measures, although they do not actually represent any physical features like transistor gate size anymore, but have become more of a marketing term. TSMC, Samsung and Intel(?) have started producing 3nm chips around 2023.

China
Intel building fabs in Portland + Arizona + Germany, will have first access to ASMLs upcoming most advanced machines
TSMC is building a fab in Arizona as well, with subsidies from the US government (copy of one of the plants in Taiwan). They are training US engineers in Taiwan and they will have engineers from Taiwan in Arizona for a couple of years to start the process.

Photonics

Arm holdings creates the arm instruction set standards and designs cpu cores that implement these instruction sets. Other companies license these architectures and/or core designs to create their own CPUs, or SOCs. Examples are Qualcomm's Snapdragon series and Samsungs Exynos series, which both implement ARM Cortex-A series core designs in their SOC designs, which are then produced by foundries (TSMC or Samsung). Similarly Broadcom designs SOCs that use Cortex-A series cores, which are for example used in Raspberry PIs. Apple's M-series SOCs use ARM ISA (instruction set architecture) but do not (at least not 1-on-1) use ARM Cortex core designs. Instead they design their own CPUs/cores. 
Arm also introduced the big.LITTLE architecture, combining powerful, power-hungry cores and slower, energy-efficient cores in a single CPU to minimize power consumption. The standard for CPUs with this architecture was 4 efficiency cores (like the Arm Cortex-A5x series) and 4 performance cores (like the Arm Cortex-A7x series). The successor of big.LITTLE is DynamIQ, which allows even more flexibility in combining different types of cores on a single CPU. A design that is being applied recently is a configuration with 3 core performance tiers on a single CPU, e.g. 1 ultra performance core (Arm X series), 3 high performance cores (Arm Cortex-A7x series) and 4 efficiency cores (Arm Cortex-A5x series).

Arm Cortex-A5x series meaning for example Arm Cortex-A55 or, more recently, Arm Cortex-A520.
