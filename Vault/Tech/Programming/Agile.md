The Agile way of software development is based on the Agile manifesto (2001):


Culture: individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
All about flexibility: everything is constantly changing, product requirements included. It is useless therefore to create a comprehensive design beforehand. Be able to respond to changes at all levels, applies to the process itself as well: if the process isn't working then change it.  
Any time spent on something other than creating customer value is waste.  
Autonomy  
Small iterative cycles of work that delivers value  
Customer/user is central in the process  
Requirements gathering upfront is useless: users rarely know what they want beforehand. People don't really know what they want until they have something in their hands.  
There is no initial design, rather designing is done iteratively throughout the process with customer feedback.  
Scrum is not equal to Agile. Scrum is a process(!) claiming to be agile (seems to go against the first principle in the agile manifesto)  
Time spent on getting everything in two weeks sprints (sizing, evaluating why something was not finished in time, moving it to a next spring) is waste.  
"Once the sprint starts requirements cannot change" is not agile. Agile acknowledges that requirements always change and you must always be able to handle those changing requirements.
