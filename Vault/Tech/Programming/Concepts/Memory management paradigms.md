There are generally three types of memory management that are used by programming languages
1. Garbage collector:
   The programmer is not tasked with determining when certain variables should be dropped from management, but the programming language has dedicated functionality called the garbage collector, which assesses whether memory can be freed or not. Examples of languages that have a garbage collector: Java, [[Memory management in Python | Python]]
2. Programmer takes care of it using low-level interfaces. Some languages require you to do explicit low level memory management. This means that a piece of memory can be reserved on the heap, references to this piece of memory are managed by the programmer and it needs to be freed up once it is no longer used. Low-level memory management is notoriously error-prone and can result in many errors, including memory leaks. Examples: [[C]], C++
3. Ownership model: In languages that use the ownership model, there is no garbage collector but the programmer is also not tasked with actively freeing up memory as it is no longer needed. Instead there is a concept of the 'owner' of a specific variable.  ... Rust is an example of a programming language that uses the ownership model.
