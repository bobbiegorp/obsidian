We keep a final vierkantscontrole where we compare the final output total cost to a single (unprocessed) number that we can get from the billing/cost explorer api in the master account.

Thoughts:
Add an extra step for calculating aggregations before support cost/shared cost calculation, because both of those steps use that aggregation.

How do we connect to CEM app for data? Use the existing export? But then if there is going to be a button in the app for starting a recalc, that should also export data to OCDS first.

Probably need to start with deciding how we'll do the component binding rules. That seems to be the most complicated part at this point with the functionality described. We should therefore design that first and see how it performs in order to decide on the concurrent vs sequential approach.

'Refund', 'Credit', removed from the filter at a later stage
Pull out the rules into a generic rule engine
Apply any new rules on the data as a test before actually deploying
