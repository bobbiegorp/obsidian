Very excited to move back into AI after a couple of years as Data/Cloud engineer
AWS training as a test. (re)Ignited my excitement for AI and implementing AI on AWS. Perfect role to combine my AI and cloud engineering backgrounds.
Closer to the business. Would like to be able to work on topics that I can explain to people who are not in PostNL or the software engineering world.
Shorter development cycles - work on something small that creates value quickly 
Opportunity to be more involved with stakeholders
